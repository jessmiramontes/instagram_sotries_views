# instagram_sotries_views

**Update Feb 6:** I combined all the csvs obtained from meta and started the sentiment analysis for the captions of the stories. So in the final dataset I will have the emotion expressed by the image and the sentiment given by the words. 
I have the program that analyzes the sentiment on the text of the story
Next step: export this information to a csv and then using the Identificador de la publicaci√≥n, add it to the archivo_combinado.csv file.
**Update Feb 8:** Sentiment analysis for captions done. Next step: clean the dataset with analytics + sentiment. I will remove statistics for videos and then combine with the image Dataset.
I created the final dataset. Next Step: Add manually the "Category".
**Update March 19:** I have the final dataset to start the EDA and the training.
