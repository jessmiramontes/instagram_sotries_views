I will combine ResNet50 and YOLOv5 as well as MobileNet to detect the activity and clothing.  Added error handling for when a file can't be read. The function adds the name to the DataFrame and NA in the other fields. Result: No activities or clothes were detected so I will remove that. I wonder what can be done with YOLOv5.
